# TicTacToe Development Progress 📝

This document tracks improvements and development status for the TicTacToe project.

## Completed Improvements ✅

- [x] First implementation: Print the board
- [x] Simplify the iswin method using loops or a more generalized approach
- [x] Make the board size configurable (e.g., via a parameter in the constructor)
- [x] Improve input handling in make_move to ensure the user is prompted until valid input is provided
- [x] Modularize the main method by breaking it into smaller, reusable methods
- [x] Add a "play again" feature to allow multiple games without restarting the program
- [x] Improve error messages and user prompts for better clarity

## In Progress 🚧

- [x] Add an AI opponent for single-player mode 

## Optimization Roadmap 🔄

- [ ] Improve the optimization:
  - [x] Add Alpha-Beta Pruning 
  - [ ] Add memoization in minimax, avoiding recalculation of the same input
  - [ ] Increase rewarding mechanism making AI algorithm give tougher competition
  - [ ] Evaluate the line, use best moves, check if taking center is best or not (partially implemented)
