# Optimized TicTacToe AI 🎮

A clean implementation of TicTacToe with an AI opponent powered by the minimax algorithm and several optimization techniques.

## Features ✨

- **Minimax Algorithm** 🧠: Decision-making engine that explores possible game outcomes
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** ✂️: Reduces unnecessary node evaluations in the search tree
- **Evaluation Line Optimization** 📈: Improves efficiency by prioritizing promising moves
- **Depth-Limited Search** 🔍: Controls search complexity while maintaining good gameplay

## How It Works 🛠️

The AI implements minimax to evaluate potential game states. Alpha-beta pruning helps eliminate branches that won't affect the final decision, improving performance. The evaluation optimization focuses on exploring more promising moves first.

## Current Status 🚧

This project is still under development. Here's what's working:
- Basic game mechanics
- Minimax implementation with alpha-beta pruning
- Simple command-line interface

## To-Do List 📝

- Optimize algorithm further
- Add difficulty levels
- Create test suite
- Add documentation

## Getting Started 🚀

[Installation and usage instructions coming soon]
